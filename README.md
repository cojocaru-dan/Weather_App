# Weather App

### This is a Team Project. Together with my teammate Laura we create our web based Weather application. 

### In this project we work with an API server to bring weather information and images to our website.

### We have an input with autocomplete feature to let the user choose what city does he want to see. After his selection we show the weather data (temperature, sky conditions, humidity, etc.) of the selected city. Searching and selecting a new city will update our page.

### The user have the option to add his favourite cities to favourite cities list and he can see this list whenever he wants.

### What are we going to learn from this project?
### - Create GET requests
### - Getting data from an open API
### - Working with CSS
### - Asynchronous functions and Promises
